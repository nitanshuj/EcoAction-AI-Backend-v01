  "narrative_text": "Living in a modest apartment in Bloomington, Indiana, this user is environmentally motivated yet faces challenges like time and knowledge gaps. They mainly drive a petrol sedan for short commutes, occasionally using public transit, and are interested in reducing their flight travel. Their diet is lightly meat-based, with some waste, and they actively recycle but aim to do so more consistently. Focused on lowering their carbon footprint and bills, they seek actionable, sustainable lifestyle changes.",
